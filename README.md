A gradle plugin to calculate Android-friendly version names and codes from git tags. If you are tired of manually updating your Android build files for each release, or generating builds that you can't trace back to code, then this plugin is for you!

## Usage

Add the plugin the top of your `app/build.gradle` (or equivalent):
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.gladed.androidgitversion' version '0.2.21'
}
```

Set `versionName` and `versionCode` from plugin results:
```groovy
android {
    // ...
    defaultConfig {
        // ...
        versionName androidGitVersion.name()
        versionCode androidGitVersion.code()
```

Use a git tag to specify your version number (see [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org))
```bash
$ git tag 1.2.3
$ gradle --quiet androidGitVersion
androidGitVersion.name	1.2.3
androidGitVersion.code	1002003
```

Any suffix after the version number in the tag (such as `-release4` in `1.2.3-release4`) is included in the version name, but is ignored when generating the version code.

## Intermediate Versions

For builds from commits that are not explicitly tagged, `name()` will return a build of this form:

`1.2.3-2-93411ff-fix_issue5-dirty`

The components in the example above are as follows:

| 1.2.3 | -2 | -93411ff | -fix_issue5 | -dirty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Most recent tag | Number of commits since tag | Commit prefix | Branch name, if branch is not listed in `hideBranches` | Present only there are uncommitted changes |

## Version Codes

Version codes are calculated relative to the most recent tag.

The code is generated by combining each version part with a multiplier. Unspecified version parts are assumed to be zero even if not supplied. So version 1.22 becomes 1022000, while version 2.4.11 becomes 2004011. This allows successive versions to have incrementing version codes.

Intermediate versions do *not* produce a new code. The code only advances when a new version tag is specified.

You can configure this behavior with `multiplier` and `parts` properties, but be warned that changing the version code scheme for a released Android project can cause problems if your new version code does not [increase monotonically](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/versioning.html).

## Methods

`name()` returns the current version name.

`code()` returns the current version code.

`flush()` flushes the internal cache of information about the git repo, in the event you have a gradle task that makes changes.

# Tasks

`androidGitVersion` prints the name and code, as shown above.

`androidGitVersionName` prints only the name.

`androidGitVersionCode` prints only the code.

## Configuration Properties

An `androidGitVersion` block in your project's `build.gradle` file can supply optional properties to configure this plugin's behavior, e.g.:

```groovy
androidGitVersion {
    prefix 'lib-'
    onlyIn 'my-library'
    multiplier 10000
    parts 2
    baseCode 2000
    hideBranches = [ 'develop' ]
    format = '%tag%%.count%%<commit>%%-branch%%...dirty%'

    overrideName { name, data ->

        // name (String) - proposed name
        // data (Object) - info used to derived proposed name:

        //   revCount (int)        - Number of commits since last relevant tag 
        //   commitPrefix (String) - Prefix hash for the current commit
        //   branchName (String)   - Branch name for the current commit
        //   dirty (boolean)       - If there are uncommitted changes
        //   lastVersion (String)  - Most recent version seen
    }

    overrideCode { code, data ->

        // code - proposed name
        // data - info used to derived proposed name:

        // (see description in overrideName method above)
    }
}
```

### prefix (string)
`prefix` sets the required prefix for any relevant version tag. For example, with `prefix 'lib'`, the tag `lib-1.5` is used to determine the version, while tags `1.0` are `app-2.4.2` are ignored.

The default prefix is `''`, which matches all numeric version tags.

### onlyIn (string)
`onlyIn` sets the required path for relevant files. Commits that change files in this path will count, while other commits will not.

For example, consider this directory tree:
```
+-- my-app/
    +-- .git/
    +-- build.gradle
    +-- app/
    |   +-- build.gradle
    |   +-- src/
    +-- lib/
        +-- build.gradle
        +-- src/
```
If `my-app/lib/build.gradle` is configured with `onlyIn 'lib'`, then changes to files in other paths (like `my-app/build.gradle` or `my-app/app/src`) will not affect the version name.

The default onlyIn path is `''`, which includes all paths.

### multiplier (int)
`multiplier` sets the space allowed each part of the version when calculating the version code.

For example, if you want version 1.2.3 to have a version code of 100020003 (allowing for 9999 patch increments), use `multiplier 10000`.

Use caution when increasing this value, as the maximum version code is 2147483647 (the maximum integer).

The default multiplier is 1000.

### parts (int)
`parts` sets the number of parts the version number will have.

For example, if you know your product will only ever use two version number parts (1.2) then use `parts 2`.

Use caution when increasing this value, as the maximum version code is 2147483647 (the maximum integer).

The default number of parts is 3.

### baseCode (int)
`baseCode` sets a floor for all generated version codes. Use this when you have already released a version with a code, and don't want to go backwards.

The default baseCode is 0.

### hideBranches (list of strings)
`hideBranches` describes which branches which should *not* be mentioned explicitly when building intermediate versions (that is, versions without a tag). This will result in cleaner intermediate version names when the branch name is obvious.

The default hideBranches are `[ 'master', 'release' ]`, meaning that intermediate builds will not show these branch names.

Note that each element of hideBranches is interpreted as a regex, for example, `[ 'master', 'feature/.*' ]`.

### format (string)
`format` defines the form of the version name.

Parts include `tag` (the last tag), `count` (number of commits, if any, since last tag), `commit` (most recent commit prefix, if any, since the last tag), `branch` (branch name, if current branch is not in `hideBranches`), and `dirty` (inserting the word "dirty" if the build was made with uncommitted changes).

Parts are delimited as `%PARTNAME%`. Other characters appearing between % marks are preserved. Parts may be omitted in which case they will not appear in the version name.

### overrideName (Closure)
`overrideName` allows you provide a hook/closure to override the proposed
name, giving you access to the same data it was derived from.

### overrideCode (Closure)
`overrideCode` allows you provide a hook/closure to override the proposed
code, giving you access to the same data it was derived from.
